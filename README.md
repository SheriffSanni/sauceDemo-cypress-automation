# SAUCEDEMO TEST

Quick test on sample scenarios of saucedemo

## Features

Cypress is a fast, easy and reliable testing for anything that runs in a browser.
Cypress comes fully baked, batteries included. Here is a list of things it can do that no other testing framework can:

* **Time Travel:** Cypress takes snapshots as your tests run. Hover over commands in the Command Log to see exactly what happened at each step.
* **Debuggability:** Stop guessing why your tests are failing. Debug directly from familiar tools like Developer Tools. Our readable errors and stack traces make debugging lightning fast.
* **Automatic Waiting:** Never add waits or sleeps to your tests. Cypress automatically waits for commands and assertions before moving on. No more async hell.
* **Spies, Stubs, and Clocks:** Verify and control the behavior of functions, server responses, or timers. The same functionality you love from unit testing is right at your fingertips.
* **Network Traffic Control:** Easily control, stub, and test edge cases without involving your server. You can stub network traffic however you like.
* **Consistent Results:** Our architecture doesn’t use Selenium or WebDriver. Say hello to fast, consistent and reliable tests that are flake-free.
* **Screenshots and Videos:** View screenshots taken automatically on failure, or videos of your entire test suite when run from the CLI.
* **Cross browser Testing:** Run tests within Firefox and Chrome-family browsers (including Edge and Electron) locally and optimally in a Continuous Integration pipeline.
* **Cypress xpath**
* **Cypress social logins**
* **Cypress file upload**
* **Cypress tags**
* **Mocha awesome report**
